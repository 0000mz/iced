## Game of Life

An interactive version of the Game of Life, invented by John Conway, implemented
on top of a `Canvas` widget and other controls.

The __[`main`]__ file contains the relevant code of the example.

    <img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BriefAccurateAardvark-size_restricted.gif">
  </a>
</div>

You can run it with `cargo run`:
```
cargo run --package game_of_life
```
